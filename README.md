# A-B-Testing-on-Mobile-Game
A/B hypothesis testing on Cookie Cats mobile game.

The Cookie Cats game has a gate at the 30th level of the game. However, the developers thought of repositioning it to level 40 and check the retention rates of the players after the repositioning. The game data consists of the retention rates after 1 day of installing and 7 days of installation of the game.

This program performs a simple A/B test on the average retention rates using the game data to know whether the move to relocate the gate to level 40 affects the retention rate or not. Results show that relocating the gate to level 40 actually drops the retention rate after 7 days of game installation. 

This concludes that the move to reposition the gate to level 40 may not work well for the game.
